The exhibit is called “Deceptive Constructions” in a way because every time the eye
begins to find traces of visual perspective in the flat space, another shape seems to
interfere and betray an initial sense of depth and perspective within the work.

Color is the artist’s latest frontier and in this case it provides the harmony, the musical
composition in the room. A sort of playful, almost digital sense to it, the artist created
this work over the last two years as an alternative to the political realities of the period.
While we do find primary colors in the reds, greens and blues throughout the works on
paper, the majority of the colors in the exhibit are tertiary ones in their purest form. Teal,Cyan Magenta and Violets found here are obtained by mixing one primary and one
secondary or two secondary colors.
