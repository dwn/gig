An important element in Karen Rifas work is the line and this exhibit allow us to
contemplate its effects. The moment we see diagonal lines our brains tend to associate
them with motion, dynamism. But when presented with horizontal or vertical lines we
sense a feeling of stability, calm. This is what is at work here as well. One may look at
the walls and feel the motion of the diagonals while as when we look at the floor and
ceiling we find that sense of stability that the large monoliths provide.
