As you walk around the gallery, let the medium “speak” to you. We have works on paper
on the walls, as well as 3D constructions in wood and vinyl laminate.Approaching the north wall of the gallery, we see the larger works on paper along with a
rectangular sculpture suspended upon the top right corner of the gallery.
Notice the softness of the paper vs the rigid nature of the works on the wall.
The curatorial decision to leave the paper pieces unframed provides us with the first
contrast. Two straight edges would certainly prove a dull configuration, but the jagged
edge of the paper, almost as if ripped from a book, plays against the straight edged
wood construction to the right of it. A balance of forms, where a subtle tension is
revealed as well.

Playing the analog counterpart to the digital wood sculptures, the large works on paper
seem to let the room “breathe” in a way. Their surfaces bent and edges curved by
gravity, they start to resemble linen, they seem to hang more like a drape in the room.
Meanwhile, suspended in the gallery’s corner is a wooden sculpture that seems to defy
gravity. This heavy wooden sculpture appears as lighter than air and floating above us.
Below is a small cube that seems to draw it downwards.
