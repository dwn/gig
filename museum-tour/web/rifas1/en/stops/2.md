A world of abstract shapes, color and line surrounds you as you walk into the gallery.
Yet at first view, we can’t help to notice the artist’s awareness of the empty space. The
“white space” as she puts it.
The deliberate placement of pieces around so much white space has the effect of
dramatically enhancing the role of the building itself
Just as in the Russian Constructivism movement of the early 20th Century, the artist
successfully incorporates the museum’s architecture into her work. By leaving the walls
empty, the artist aims to say as much with the void as the with the pieces on display.
These pieces invoke a sort of new spatial relationship within existing architecture. The
museum is no longer a room where you hang pictures. To Rifas, the building is almost
like another medium, becoming an intrinsic element to the art itself.
