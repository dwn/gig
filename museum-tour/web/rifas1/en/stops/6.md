The L-Shaped pieces on the floor can be used as benches and are directly attributed to
the blocky roots of Russian Constructivism sculptures. The floor applique, a site-specific
element is a true square of 12 feet x 12 feet, is composed of three smaller rectangles of
4x12â€™ each. Turning the gallery into the most instagrammable spots in the museum!
In a way is almost like being inside a Tetris-themed Pop-Up room. Tetris is a Russian
video game that uses the same L-shaped blocks introduced by the Russian
Constructivism avant-garde movement of the early 20tth Century.
