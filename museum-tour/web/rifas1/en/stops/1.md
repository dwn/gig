Deceptive Constructions is Karen Rifasâ€™ latest body of work. Based in Miami for over 60
years, the artist presents us today with a new frontier in her artistic practice. Developed
over the last two years, we encounter a work that goes beyond her known exploration of
geometry and the possibilities of space, this time she plunges us into the realm of color
as well.
